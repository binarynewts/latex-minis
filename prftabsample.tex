Wrap your proof in \verb|\prfstart| and \verb|\prfend|. Start each line with either \verb|\prfreason| to explain the reasoning for the steps, or \verb|\prfstep| to give a numbered step. Refer to prior steps using \verb|\prfrefer|

Casing works the same as proofs, just replacing \verb|prf| with \verb|case| as needed (though you don't need to end your cases, just your proofs (starting a proof puts you in a tabbing environment)).

\begin{verbatim}
\prfstart
\prfreason Because of reason,
\prfstep This thing is true.
\prfreason Because of the previous thing \prfrefer{1},
\prfstep We can split into cases.
%
%
\casestart The first case.
\casereason Since I'm in this case,
\casestep I can do this thing.
%
%
\casestart The second case.
\casereason Being here,
\casestep This is true.
\casereason Because \caserefer{1} and \prfrefer{1},
\casestep Tada!
%
%
\prfstep Maybe there are more things here now idk.
\prfend
